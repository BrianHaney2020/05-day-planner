# 05-day-planner
Homework for week 5.  

The application pulls a date using moment.js, and display it in the 
jumbotron-style header.

Below the header, there are hour long blocks for a standard business day.
The user can enter an item in the text input for a particular hour.  If the
user then hits the save icon to the right, the value will be saved in local storage and will be available when the page is refreshed or reloaded.

There is also funcionality in the code that looks at whether each block occurs in the past, present (current time's hour matches the block's hour) or future and color codes the input box based on that.  Grey=past, red=current, green=future.
